# -KSP-1.0.2-EmDrive-
Adds the EmDrive Microwave Thruster to Kerbal Space Program. Right now it's only a rehashing of the Ion Drive with modified textures and *.cfg file. 
It uses lots of Electric charge and a little bit of Liquid Hydrogen from the Cryogenic Engines mod and outputs a small amount of Hydrogen for use in mods like TAC Life Support.
